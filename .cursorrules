# Cursor Rules for Local Mad Monkey V3 Workspace
# This file is local-only and not committed to any repo

## Workspace Structure
- This is a LOCAL workspace combining two independent repos:
  - `frontend/` - Next.js application (separate repo for frontend team)
  - `backend/` - Bun + Hono service (separate repo for backend team)

## Context Awareness
- When working in `frontend/`, understand it's a Next.js app with:
  - Pages-based routing in `pages/`
  - Components in `components/`
  - Redux store in `store/`
  - Generated API client in `v3/api/`
  - Path aliases: `@/*` maps to `frontend/*`

- When working in `backend/`, understand it's a Hono service with:
  - Routes in `src/routes/`
  - Services in `src/services/`
  - OpenAPI schemas in `src/openapi/`
  - Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL

## Cross-Package Context
- Frontend uses generated API client from backend OpenAPI schema
- Backend API typically runs on different port than frontend
- Respect each package's independent structure and conventions
- Don't create cross-package dependencies or shared code

## Code Generation
- Frontend API client is generated: `npm run gen:api` in `frontend/`
- Backend OpenAPI schema: `backend/src/openapi/`
- Don't manually edit generated files in `frontend/v3/api/`

## TypeScript
- Each package has its own `tsconfig.json`
- Frontend: strict mode, path aliases configured
- Backend: strict mode, Bun runtime
